Project Introduction
Welcome to the Student Performance Analysis project!

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of student performance using the student-por.csv dataset. The project focuses on:

Data Preprocessing: Transforming categorical variables into numerical values for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the relationships between student performance and various factors such as study time, absences, and support.
Visualization: Generating insightful visualizations to compare grades and analyze the distribution of categorical data.
Predictive Modeling: Developing and evaluating a linear regression model to predict final grades based on initial grades.
This analysis aims to uncover key factors influencing student performance and provide predictive insights for educational improvement.

Feel free to explore the code and visualizations to understand how different factors impact student success and how predictions can be made based on the data.
